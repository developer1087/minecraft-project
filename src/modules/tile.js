// The Tile Class serves as the base class for specific types of tiles present in the game, such as
// rock, dirt, tree, etc. Specific tiles will inherit from this class, allowing for different behaviors based
// on the type of the tile. Each subclass will contain properties to determine the type of tile and
// whether it can be removed or added.
